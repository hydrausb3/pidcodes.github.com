The xwhatsit capacitive keyboard controller is a USB hardware and firmware keyboard controller project (both open source) started by Deskthority.net and geekhack.org forum member xwhatsit and continued by forum members wcass, pandrew, Ellipse, Rico, and others to serve as a USB controller for Model F capacitive buckling spring and Beam Spring keyboards and various other user-created keyboards.  All firmware, hardware, and software for this project is open source, covered under GPLv3.
