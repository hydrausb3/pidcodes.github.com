The `0x33.board` is a 48-key isomorphic MIDI key controller.

It supports USB-MIDI, TRS-MIDI (out only) and I2C. It also has a jack for 1-bit headphone output.
The 48 keys of the main note surface are arranged in four staggered rows of twelve keys each.
Each key has independent RGB backlighting that can be used to highlight scales, melodies or chords.

Settings can be changed on the device using the menu display and three dedicated menu keys.
